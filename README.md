# Speed Read

This is the github page for the results and code to reproduce the results for:
1. Counting Cards: Exploiting Weight and Variance Distributions for Robust Compute In-Memory
2. Breaking Barriers: Maximizing Array Utilization for Compute In-Memory Fabrics

This tool has evolved to support different readout algorithms and system level allocation policies. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3
gcc
g++
cvxpy
cvxopt
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/bcrafton/speed_read
```

### Running

```
cd speed_read/
python tb.py
```

## Hardware

I run parallel tests with 8 threads, but this can be configured for more if you have them.
