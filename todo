-------

can we make a quantize_weight function
or scheme
that tries to quantize things to give us more zeros ? 

can really think of it as a giant mapping function
that maps things from float to decimal values.

-------

what about a different encoding format
where numbers will lots of 1s are 255 or something like this.
