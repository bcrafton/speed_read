we probably want 64 bits per array ? 128 is crazy ...

params = {
'bpa': 8,
'bpw': 8,
'rpr': 10,
'adc': 8,
'skip': 1
}

so we need to break this up.
bpw needed at both conv/pim level
is bpa ? 

dont really want to break up these annoying params
we cud just pass it to each layer.

lets do that for now.

-----

randomness in #pim comes from 2 things:
1) if using weight stats (of course)
2) in multi-layer networks, weights cause activation after layer 1 to be random

since LSTM sparsity maybe we can just use LSTM as primary thing
... wonder if we can argue PIM can inherently do sparsity better.

okay we can make this happen.

lets start by replacing quantize_and_dequantize.

[81008, 83808, 81440] = 8
wasnt 16 = 60000
what is up with that ...
[64160, 65864, 64936]

yeah wtf.
this is a totally different game than what i thought.

if 16 over 8 dosnt buy u a serious advantage ... then we have been doing something wrong. 

-----

setting wl = 1024
> 35520, 37240, 35656
what the fuck ??? 

definitely feels like we on to something here,
well a bug atleast
also seems like we need:
1) multi threading
2) writing this kernel in c or something.

something that is not so horribly slow.

you might be able to go at 16->17 or 8->9 for free.
just because u can start at 17 if u failed.
nah because then the rest of ur numbers are fucked up.

-----

okay so now we can see the advantage to using 16 over 8
but is it though ? 
what are odds differences between 
20/16 vs 10/8 ?

okay but then why are there so few pims for the larger operations.

wow! there are so few 1s in these activations.
40/576 is probably the average.

when you make wl=1024
then it basically makes everything go as fast

64x32 takes same number of bitlines as 3x32.
just has slightly more ones.

-----

very interesting idea:
we are aware of quantization value = 100 probably or w.e.
and we know what our sums are.
so we can pick the speed to go at based on this information.

so to me, this means we go in the wrong order.

we wud want to start with b=7 and go down the line.

-----

okay so how do we make this work ?

then how fast we can go

what can we compute in advance ?

-----

we can use (1/4) C interfaces:

how can we make python code faster ? 
> parallelize it all.
> stick to 128x128 arrays.

-----

how do we do variance ? 
think it would be best.
to add variance after the fact.
yeah keep things to integers, then multiply by the number of states or w.e.
we know that any 1s are w.ON & x.ON

-----

something is not right here, we can read at crazy speeds.
solved it lol.

-----

okay we got a nice little setup here.
can see [min, max, mean, std] differences in feature maps.

rpr error = binomial
for range(adc+1, rpr+1):

instead of

maybe it should be for all states then.

> so the thing im worried about.
is we cud go even faster
and have valid c code.

https://cai.tools.sap/blog/how-to-speed-up-python-with-c/

ctypes is an option.
lets go with cython
seems like the clear path forward.
threading wud be my concern.

------

https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/numpy.html

this is gonna suck to speedup because:
> y -= mu.reshape(oshape, bpw) @ shift

maybe we just write the whole thing in ctypes
really dont think it wud be that bad.

we wud need to just write the c code and a test bench
and make sure it works.

-----

and it really just needs to be the dot function.
still cant tell if it is worth the effort.
mkl gives nothing it seems.

we need to write c functions for:
> np.random.normal
> binom.pmf

might be too much effort.

-----

we dont really know how long these things will take anyways...
> havnt tried parllelizing top level workload.

-----

so we really just need to make this thing run faster.
so we are gonna re-code it
and probably use ctypes.

we can see what kind of speedup we can get
by tossing out variance and that stuff.

using it as an estimate before going further.

-----

> so basically we want speed vs variance plot.
> two different kinds of those plots but thats not important

we need to run 10 different variance for:
count = 1
count = 0

-----

how do we want this table structured ? 
> [examples] * layer * (var, cards)

can we plot all the layers on same graph ?

-----

author of that paper makes it pretty clear.
for training:
batch mean/std

for inference:
moving averages from training of mean/std.

so really it should not be that hard to come up with this ...

-----

we do this in quantize
> tf.clip_by_value(x, low, high)

feel like there shud not be a need for clip by value.

cifar10 accuracy.
fill in these damn sections with stuff.
pdlsyn figures, this we can do
batch norm was impossible.

alright how do we use this quantize setup now ?
