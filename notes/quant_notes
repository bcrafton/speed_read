if we want additional accuracy
I believe you can stop quantizing based on 14.
and quantize all layers to -128, 127
BUT
then quantize the two residuals based on profiled data.

ALSO 
we probably want to fix all the quantize that clip values 
and dont scale based on absolute value.

THE REASON WHY POSITIVE WEIGHTS ARE FINE
is becuase of batch norm.
